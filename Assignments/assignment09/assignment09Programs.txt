1. Write a TypeScript program to list the properties of a TypeScript object
var student = {
name : "David Rayy",
sclass : "VI",
rollno : 12 };
Sample Output: name,sclass,rollno

2. Write a TypeScript program to delete the rollno property from the following object. Also print the object before or after deleting the property.
Sample object:
var student = {
name : "David Rayy",
sclass : "VI",
rollno : 12 };
 

3. Write a TypeScript program to get the length of a TypeScript object.   
Sample object :
var student = {
name : "David Rayy",
sclass : "VI",
rollno : 12 };
 

4. Write a TypeScript program to display the reading status (i.e. display book name, author name and reading status) of the following books.   

var library = [ 
   {
       author: 'Bill Gates',
       title: 'The Road Ahead',
       readingStatus: true
   },
   {
       author: 'Steve Jobs',
       title: 'Walter Isaacson',
       readingStatus: true
   },
   {
       author: 'Suzanne Collins',
       title:  'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', 
       readingStatus: false
   }];

Volume of a cylinder : V = Ï€r2h
where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
 

6. Write a Bubble Sort algorithm in TypeScript.   
Note : Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
Sample Data: [6,4,0, 3,-2,1]
Expected Output : [-2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
 

7. Write a TypeScript program which returns a subset of a string.   
Sample Data: dog
Expected Output: ["d", "do", "dog", "o", "og", "g"]
 

8. Write a TypeScript program to create a Clock.   
Note: The output will come every second.
Expected Console Output :
"14:37:42"
"14:37:43"
"14:37:44"
"14:37:45"
"14:37:46"
"14:37:47"
 

9. Write a TypeScript program to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle.   
Note : Create two methods to calculate the area and perimeter. The radius of the circle will be supplied by the user.
 

10. Write a TypeScript program to sort an array of TypeScript objects.   
Sample Object :

var library = [ 
   {
       title:  'The Road Ahead',
       author: 'Bill Gates',
       libraryID: 1254
   },
   {
       title: 'Walter Isaacson',
       author: 'Steve Jobs',
       libraryID: 4264
   },
   {
       title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
       author: 'Suzanne Collins',
       libraryID: 3245
   }];
Expected Output:

[[object Object] {
  author: "Walter Isaacson",
  libraryID: 4264,
  title: "Steve Jobs"
}, [object Object] {
  author: "Suzanne Collins",
  libraryID: 3245,
  title: "Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games"
}, [object Object] {
  author: "The Road Ahead",
  libraryID: 1254,
  title: "Bill Gates"
}]
 

11. Write a TypeScript function to print all the methods in an TypeScript object.   
Test Data :
console.log(all_properties(Array));
["length", "name", "arguments", "caller", "prototype", "isArray", "observe", "unobserve"]

 
12. Write a TypeScript function to parse an URL.

15. Write a TypeScript function to convert an object into a list of `[key, value]` pairs.   
 

16. Write a TypeScript function to get a copy of the object where the keys have become the values and the values the keys.   
 

17. Write a TypeScript function to check whether an object contains given property.
